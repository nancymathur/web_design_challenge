## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this homework I creatED a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, plotting THE [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. This also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
